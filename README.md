# Bite4Byte Hackathon

This repo is from a recent hackathon challenge, Bite4bByte, where we were challeneged to help the Granite Education Foundation build a solution for their food pantries.  My team of four DevMountain grads spent the day building an inventory management system to help food pantry coordinators visualize and maintain their inventory and their clients.  This simple app, built in an afternoon, can be used as a foundation to help others build their own inventory control systems.
